This includes evening classes and distance learning resources.\n\nThese schemes help to raise the overall educational level of the workforce.",
    "Agriculture Subsidies" : "For strategic reasons some governments are happy to pay subsidies to farmers to ensure the security of the nation's food supply.\n\nThis goes against free market economics and can also be very expensive, but it does safeguard jobs (and votes) in agricultural communities.",
    "Airline Tax" : "Airline fuel has generally not been subject to taxation.\n\nSupporters of air fuel taxes insist that this results in an unfair subsidy on an environmentally destructive form of transport.\n\nThe airlines point out that taxing airline fuel will just encourage them to refuel elsewhere thereby diverting funds from our economy.",
    "Alcohol Law" : "There is ample evidence that excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to health problems and even premature death.\n\nHowever, some people object to the state interfering in an individual's right to choose what he/she drinks.\n\nThere is also the complication that the government can make a lot of money by taxing alcohol.",
    "Alcohol Tax" : "Medically there is a clear case for the government to tax alcohol in order to discourage consumption because of its negative effects on health and its possible links to social breakdown.\n\nOn the other hand, those who drink socially see the government benefiting from such a tax to be hypocritical.",
    "Armed Police" : "Arming police officers can be an effective strategy in deterring crime and maintaining order.\n\nOpponents would argue that it encourages criminals to use firearms in a 'criminal arms race'.\n\nCritics also worry that arming the police will distance them from law-abiding citizens.",
    "Ban Sunday Shopping" : "The Christian religion generally recognizes the 'Sabbath' as a 'day of rest' and many religious people believe that there should be no shopping carried out on that day.\n\nSome trade unions also believe that an enforced day of rest prevents its members being exploited.",
    "Biofuel Subsidies" : "Biofuels can reduce oil demand, by mixing ethanol derived from corn with petro-chemical fuel.\n\nThis is generally popular with environmentalists.Farmers who earn money producing corn for biofuel use also benefit.\n\nBiofuels with a higher mix of ethanol can be subsidized through tax breaks.",
    "Border Controls" : "Without some kind of customs checks at the borders, your country is open to the problem of mass illegal immigration.\n\nSome people argue that these immigrants cause crime, others that they take jobs away from your own citizens.\n\nBorder controls can be effective in reducing illegal immigration.",
    "Bus Lanes" : "Setting aside specific lanes of a road for use only by buses (and perhaps taxis and motorbikes) is one way to get traffic flowing faster and avoid congestion. It also shortens journey times for public transport and therefore encourages usage.\n\nThere are noticeable costs involved in setting up such schemes, and motorists can be annoyed if the bus lanes seem empty while they remain stuck in traffic.",
    "Bus Subsidies" : "Traffic congestion and pollution can be reduced by encouraging people to travel by bus instead of car.\n\nIt can be an expensive option though, and some motorists may resent a transport system they do not use being subsidized.",
    "Carbon Tax" : "A carbon tax is a tax levied on all emissions of Carbon Dioxide, thought to be the main cause of climate change.\n\nThe tax is effectively a pollution tax, and a way to make those individuals and industries who contribute to climate change pay for the damage they cause or to reduce emissions.\n\nObviously the tax is popular with environmentalists, and can also lead to a more energy efficient economy.",
    "Car Emission Limits" : "Setting legal limits on exhaust fumes helps to reduce air pollution, especially in cities,\nbut it's unpopular with motorists who look upon it as yet more bureaucracy and tax.",
    "Car Tax": "Taxing the ownership of all motor vehicles is one way to persuade people to use alternative forms of transport.\n\nIt can be argued however, that such a system increases the fixed costs of car ownership, encouraging people to use a car more once they have gone to the trouble of taxing it.\n\nThere is also an argument that this is a tax that unfairly hits the poor and people in rural communities where a car is a necessity.",
    "CCTV Cameras" : "CCTV cameras can be a great help in catching criminals and cameras also deter crime.\n\nThe installation costs are extremely high, and there are concerns about civil rights from people who don't like to feel that the government is constantly watching them.",
    "Child Benefit" : "A fixed payment made by the state directly to parents to assist in the cost of bringing up children.\n\nPopular with parents for obvious reasons, and the poor who see it as a redistributive tax, but capitalists are opposed to such an unnecessary level of interference by government.",
    "Childcare Provision" : "By giving state subsidies for childcare, we can ensure more parents return to the workforce after having children, and therefore benefit the economy.\n\nAlthough this can be expensive, and is also a distortion of the market, it is popular with parents.",
    "Citizenship Tests" : "Citizenship tests are a way of ensuring that people migrating to our country have a demonstrable understanding of our culture and history.\n\nThis lessens the chances of a clash of cultures for newcomers to the country, encourages integration and reassures patriotic members of society that they need not fear immigration.",
    "Clean Energy Subsidies" : "Renewable energy might not be ultra efficient yet, but there is an argument for investing heavily in it now so as to strategically prepare our country for a future without fossil fuels.\n\nEnvironmentalists are happy for obvious reasons, but capitalists see it as an unwelcome distortion of the energy market.",

    "Community Policing" : "Working with the community rather than attempting to control it. Community policing encourages the police to better understand the needs of the local community, especially in areas with ethnic minorities.\n\nCritics see it as an expensive waste of money which could be spent on more direct methods to cut crime.",
    "Consumer Rights" : "At a minimum level, the state guarantees that the consumer is not totally ripped off.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, draconian legislation can benefit the consumer at the expense of business.\n\nCompanies often complain about the amount of legislation governing selling to the public.",
    "Corporation Tax" : "A direct and proportionate tax on the profits of business.\n\nSome argue that this should be the only form of taxation, others that such taxes stifle entrepreneurship and discourage people from starting a business.\n\nIt is often one of the main ways the government brings in money.",
    "Creationism vs. Evolution" : "A bitter battle has raged about the way children are taught evolution versus creationism.\n\nScientists and Liberals consider it obvious that evidence based evolution should be taught in science classes.\n\nSome religious groups feel that it is wrong to teach evolution or 'Darwinism' as fact, when it remains an unproven theory or that creationism should be taught as an alternative theory in science.\n\nThe government has to decide what is taught in our schools.",
    "Curfews" : "Introduced for a short period of time in state of national emergency.

    "Faith School Subsidies" : "Religious schools can achieve good academic standards.\n\nTheir supporters make a case that the government should subsidize methods of education that are proven to be effective.\n\nCritics say that religion has no place in education and that the government cannot be seen to 'push' a particular religion on children.",
    "Foreign Aid" : "Some foreign countries have very poor economies, poor education or food shortages, and it can be argued that relatively rich nations such as ours have a moral duty to help them.\n\nOthers may argue that the first priority of any nation is to its own citizens, and if those citizens wish to help, they can do so individually through charities.",
    "Free Bus Passes" : "Traditionally, free bus travel is offered as a concession to those citizens of retirement age.\n\nThis can be expensive, but it’s a great way to reduce car usage and thus reduce pollution and congestion.\n\nSome oppose such a distortion of the market however.",
    "Free Eye Tests" : "Eye tests catch problems early and advise those with poor eyesight that they need glasses.\n\nGetting your eyes tested privately can be expensive, and it's a luxury many people just do without.\n\nSocialists believe that the universal provision of free eye tests are essential in providing a health 'safety net' for all.",

    "Graduate tax" : "A graduate tax is a deciated tax levied purely on people graduating from university, as a way of them contributing to the cost of their university tuition.\n\nSupporters say this is fair because not everyone benefits from a university education.\n\nOpponents argue that it creates a disincentive to study purely academic subjects and the arts, as well as penalizing ambition.",
    "Handgun Laws" : "Some countries allow the virtually unrestricted ownership of any kind of firearm, whereas in others it is strictly controlled.\n\nSome people talk of the basic right to defend yourself, others are concerned that gun ownership leads to gun crime.",
    "Hybrid Cars" : "Hybrid cars are less damaging to the environment, because at slower speeds they use electric engines that produce no CO2. They also get higher fuel efficiency, thus reducing demand for oil.\n\nThe downside is they are very expensive, but tax incentives can encourage more people to buy hybrid models when they get new cars.",
    "ID Cards" : "Some say ID Cards act as a powerful deterrent against terrorism and other serious crimes.\n\nLiberals would argue that it is an infringement of an individual's civil liberties for the state to demand that citizens identify themselves on the spot.",
    "Import Tariffs" : "Cheap imports can be damaging to the economy because local companies cannot match the lower salaries paid by foreign competitors.\n\nImport tariffs help to protect local manufacturers from 'unfair' competition.\n\nThis does go against real free-market economics though, and can be seen as being unfair to foreign countries, possibly sparking retaliation.",
    "Income Tax" : "One of the most popular ways to raise money for government is a direct tax on peoples earnings, deducted at source by their employer.\n\nIncome tax is generally a progressive tax (the wealthy pay more as a fraction of their income than the poor) and for this reason it is popular with socialists and the low paid.",
    "Flat Income Tax" : "A flat-rate income tax is a tax where every citizen pays the same marginal rate of income tax regardless of their total income.\n\nAs a result, the cleaner in the office pays the same rate as the CEO, though the CEO's total tax bill will be higher.\n\nThis simpler structure can lead to lower avoidance and evasion.\n\nIt is not progressive, and can exacerbate income inequality.",
    "Capital Gains Tax" : "CGT is a tax levied on non-salary income such as stock market profits and share dividends, and profits from selling property or other assets.\n\nPrimarily it affects the wealthy and business owners, and will raise more money if the economy is booming.\n\nBecause it taxes profits from investments, it also acts as a slight deterrent to investment and thus be detrimental to the economy.",
    "Inheritance Tax" : "A tax paid on the wealth of an individual as it is passed on to their descendants.\n\nAn inheritance tax protects equality, by preventing families amassing wealth and advantage over the generations, so it is popular with socialists and the poor.\n\nHowever, some people are strongly opposed to anything that prevents them handing on their hard-earned wealth, especially their house, to their children.",
    "Intelligence Services" : "Security services are an essential tool in the fight against organized crime and terrorism.\n\nGood, reliable intelligence can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and in many cases the methods employed can be unpopular with liberals and human rights advocates.",
    "Internet Censorship" : "Liberals would suggest that the internet's greatest characteristic is its freedom from censorship and control, leading to an open and tolerant society.\n\nFreedom has its price however, and there is no shortage of material on the internet that can assist those with criminal intent.\n\nOpinion on what should and should not be censored on the web is bitterly divided.",
    "Internet Tax" : "As more and more commerce moves from conventional 'bricks and mortar' establishments to the web, governments are tempted to levy taxes on such transactions in order to 'level the playing field'.\n\nHowever, opponents of an internet tax claim that such a move would cripple the hi-tech economy and do enormous harm to the country's competitiveness.",
    "Jury Trial" : "The right to be tried by ordinary members of the public rather than a judge is seen as a fundamental human right by many liberals.\n\nConservatives argue that such a process is expensive, time wasting and is no fairer than a judge or a group of magistrates.\n\nIts entirely possible to have a system where a jury trial is reserved for more serious offences, with minor trials presided over by a magistrate.",
    "Labor Laws" : "Labor laws are basically restrictions on a worker's right to strike.\n\nCapitalists argue that such restrictions are vital to prevent key workers such as power station workers, policemen and train drivers from holding the country to ransom.\n\nTrade unionists consider the right to strike to be fundamental and not open to negotiation.",
    "Legal Aid" : "Not everyone has the money to pay a lawyer to defend themselves in court.\n\nAlthough a citizen could theoretically defend himself, providing state-employed lawyers should make for a fairer system.\n\nOn the other hand, this is basically a big subsidy to people who have already been charged with a crime but remember they are innocent until proved guilty.",
    "Legalize Prostitution" : "Conservatives claim that the legalization of prostitution would mark a severe decline in family values.\n\nOthers claim that as prostitution is unlikely to disappear, even if illegal, it's better for society and prostitutes that the practice is regulated and monitored rather than criminalized.",
    "Luxury Goods Tax" : "A tax aimed specifically at the high spenders in our society.\n\nA surcharge is added to high value luxuries such as sports cars, private yachts etc.\n\nAlthough it is never a vast source of income, a luxury goods tax can be popular with those people concerned with the gap between rich and poor.\n\nA luxury goods tax could encourage high earners to live and work elsewhere.",
    "Married Tax Allowance" : "This is a tax break for married couples, given as an encouragement for people to marry and also to stick together.\n\nChurch groups see it as essential that the state encourages traditional family values.\n\nSome see it as religion meddling in the tax system for no good reason.",
    "Maternity Leave" : "To some people, ensuring that mothers have a right to maternity leave and to return to their jobs afterwards is a sign of a civilized society, and one that encourages women to work.\n\nSome small businesses are concerned that it can put an unpredictable and even potentially crippling burden on an employer, especially where the number of employees is small.\n\nIt could be argued that this actually encourages employers not to employ women.",
    "Micro-Generation Grants" : "These grants are given to citizens to help subsidize the cost of energy micro-generation systems such as solar panels and wind turbines.\n\nThis is a good way to take advantage of some people's desire to make a personal step towards cleaner and greener energy, and will increase the country's overall energy efficiency.",
    "Military Spending" : "A modern, well equipped military can cost an absolute fortune, and many people feel that the money could best be spent elsewhere.\n\nOthers (especially patriots) would argue that you cannot put a price on freedom and security, and also point out the huge benefits for our businesses, technology and employment figures.",
    "National Monorail System" : "Monorails are often seen as the transport system of the future. They are promoted as being fast, reliable and environmentally beneficial.\n\nThe main problem however is the high cost.\n\nThe construction time is also a major consideration so investment in a national network would take a long time to give an eventually good payoff.",
    "Mortgage Tax Relief" : "This allows people to claim tax relief on the interest payments they have to make when they borrow money to buy a house.\n\nThis helps homebuyers to afford their mortgage payments, but can be resented by those who are not in a position to buy a house, as it is effectively a tax break for homebuyers.",
    "Narcotics" : "Should drugs such as cannabis and heroin be legalized?\n\nSupporters suggest that it is the crime associated with the buying black-market drugs that cause problems, and legalizing narcotics would reduce crime.\n\nOpponents point to the health risks and say it would be giving into criminals.",
    "National Service" : "Compulsory military service for some citizens where they are taught the basics of how to defend this country from attack has some benefits.\n\nFor example it would allow us to have a smaller regular army.\n\nHowever, there are concerns about forcing people to bear arms against their will.",
    "Organ Donation" : "There are few who would disagree that organ transplant is an amazing technology but it requires a plentiful supply of donors.\n\nSadly many people do not give the topic consideration.\n\nSome suggest that an 'opt-out' policy is best, with consent for donation assumed unless otherwise stated.\n\nOthers suggest that this is no place for the state to interfere and explicit permission should be requested.",
    "Organic Farming Subsidy" : "Supporters of organic farming say the state should subsidize this method of farming because of the perceived health benefits of food without artificial flavorings and additives.\n\nNaturally this is popular with farmers and environmentalists, but some people see it as a pointless distortion of what should be a free market.",
    "Petrol Tax" : "Taxing fuel can be a huge source of income for a government, and can also be seen as a 'green' policy by encouraging people to drive less, or to use more fuel efficient cars.\n\nCritics suggest that this is just another cynical tax on the motorist, and some complain that the alternative (public transport) is not a viable option for everyone.",
    "Wire Tapping" : "From a law and order perspective, wire tapping is an essential weapon in the fight against organized crime and terrorism.\n\nThe problem is that it's difficult to prevent misuse of such a system, and liberals are keen to point out how widespread wire tapping is a very sinister sign of a police state.",
    "Plastic Bag Tax" : "Plastic bags, unlike paper ones are not biodegradable so can last more or less forever, eventually ending up in huge unsightly landfill sites.\n\nA tax on bags discourages their use and encourages people to re-use stronger, more environmentally friendly alternatives.\n\nCapitalists just see this as the state meddling.",
    "Police Force" : "Every government needs to employ a police force to ensure order is kept and laws are obeyed, but it's a matter of debate exactly how much should be spent on the police.\n\nSome favor a large force with police on every street corner, other prefer a more low-key and tolerant approach.",
    "Pollution Controls" : "Restrictions on what chemicals and emissions can be released into the atmosphere.\n\nControls reduce pollution and increase health, possibly at the cost of economic competitiveness.",
    "Prisoner Tagging" : "A high tech alternative to incarceration that allows people to re-integrate with the community upon release from prison, whilst allowing law enforcement authorities to keep a close eye on them.\n\nLiberals have concerns that such a system is a step towards a police state which monitors our every move.",
    "Prisons" : "Some argue that providing the minimum number of bare, cold cells is the only provision that needs to be made for those who have broken the law.\n\nOthers suggest that spending more money allows for prisoners to be rehabilitated as well as punished and reduces the chances of reoffending.",
    "Property Tax" : "Property tax is a tax levied on the value of homes. The valuation is often made by a government body, and the money is used to fund local government services (at least in part) such as the provision of street lighting and emergency services.\n\nSome see it as a fair tax which mostly affects those who own large homes and are wealthy, others see it as an unfair tax on retired people with large homes but little actual income.",
    "Public Libraries" : "Public libraries provide a number of services:, acting as a focus for communities, providing access to information and literature to those on low incomes, and enabling people to learn new skills outside the normal educational establishment.",
    "Racial Profiling" : "Racial (or ethnic) profiling is the practice of using race as a factor in identifying criminals and potential criminals.\n\nLaw enforcement officials claim that using racial profiling allows them to quickly narrow down lists of potential suspects, and to best concentrate their efforts but opponents fear that it leads to racial discrimination by the police.",
    "Race Discrimination Act" : "Prevents citizens being discriminated against purely on the basis of race, i.e. racist employment practices etc.",
    "Rail Subsidies" : "Travelling by rail is not only more environmentally sound than car travel, its much more efficient in terms of transport times and congestion.\n\nOf course that requires adequate investment over the very long term, and in the meantime, motorists take offence at subsidizing a system they do not use.\n\nIt can take several years for the effects of rail investment to take effect.",
    "Recycling" : "Supporters of recycling argue that dumping waste in landfills just isn't a long term solution, and the government needs to show the way by providing facilities to recycle as many waste materials as possible.\n\nThis might include recycling newspapers, cardboard, bottles and even some plastics.",
    "Road Building" : "Although environmentalists often argue that more roads just lead to more congestion, not surprisingly this isn't how the motorist who is sat in traffic sees it.\n\nBuilding new roads is a very expensive and very slow process, but some suggest its vital to keep our economy functioning.",
    "Rural Development" : "As technology advances and more and more citizens take jobs in our cities, there is a danger that poverty and unemployment will rise to unacceptable levels in the countryside.\n\nRural development grants do distort the free market, but they also support rural businesses and prevent poverty amongst farmers and other rural occupations.",
    "Sales Tax" : "Sales tax is the classic 'regressive' tax, which means it does not take into account the ability to pay.\n\nCritics argue that this affects the poor disproportionately and thus increases inequality.\n\nSupporters argue that it is relatively easy to collect and affects everyone, and is thus fair.\n\nBusinesses can be opposed to the administrative burden of the tax.",
    "Satellite Road Pricing" : "An expensive system that requires transponders to be fitted to everyone's car and keeps track of what roads people use (and when).\n\nAllows per-road pricing for car usage which gives local authorities fine control over reducing congestion without burdening motorists in more remote rural areas who have no alternative transport system.",
    "Sub. School Bus" : "State subsidies for school buses ensure that every school kid has an efficient, and safe journey to school, whilst reducing the number of short 'school-run' trips carried out by parents, thus reducing traffic on the roads.\n\nParents are also happier knowing that there are proper approved school buses.",
    "School Prayers" : "Liberals will often argue that the education of our younger citizens should be kept entirely separate from any religious teachings.\n\nOn the other hand, it's argued that some compulsory prayer in schools is a way of promoting moral values in our children.",
    "Science Funding" : "In some countries, the majority of research is funded by private companies.\n\nState-sponsored science can be useful for investing in very long-term research projects or those that may not be commercially rewarding.\n\nThe benefits of state sector research are freely available to the entire population, rather than patented by corporations.",
    "Small Business Grants" : "The failure rate for small businesses is very high.\n\nIn the early years of trading, a preferential government grant can be an enormous help to get a new enterprise off the ground.\n\nThis can lead to a big boost to the economy, but it can also be an expensive policy with no guarantee of good results.",
    "Space Program" : "Invest in your country's efforts to explore space!\n\nAs well as the purely scientific benefits, a well-funded space program will boost the level of technological expertise throughout the entire economy.\n\nIt will also unite the country and encourage patriotism.",
    "Speed Cameras" : "Speed cameras are an automated way to enforce speed restrictions on our roads, without having to invest a fortune in extra traffic police.\n\nSupporters claim they reduce road deaths and free up the police to deal with more serious crime, opponents claim they are a cynical way of taxing the motorist and have nothing to do with safety",
    "State Health Service" : "Although many citizens would be happy to pay privately for their own health treatment, there is an argument that the state has a duty to provide a minimum level of free health treatment for everyone regardless of income.\n\nHealth provision can be expensive, so it's a matter of debate as to how much should be spent.",
    "State Housing" : "Some citizens prefer to own their own homes, but the cost of housing is such that a large proportion of the population live in rented accommodation.\n\nState housing is provided, at a reduced rate, to those who cannot afford to pay the market rate.\n\nThis can be expensive to fund, but the social benefits are also significant.",
    "State Pensions" : "Rather than leave it up to the individual to provide for themselves after retirement, state pensions can guarantee a minimum standard of living for the elderly.\n\nBe aware that as life expectancy rises, the cost to the state of paying out pensions increases hugely.\n\nThe level of state pension may encourage or discourage citizens to save into private pension plans.",
    "State Schools" : "Free education for all ensures high levels of literacy and can be beneficial to the economy, especially those parts of the economy requiring a skilled workforce.\n\nThe flipside of this is that state education can be expensive for the government.\n\nWealthy individuals, not making use of state schools, may resent subsidizing them.",
    "Stem Cell Research" : "A stem cell is a primitive type of cell that can be developed into most of the types of cells found in the human body.\n\nSome scientists claim that stem cell research offers great hope for curing diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis.\n\nHowever, because stem cells are taken from discarded human embryos, many 'pro-life' and religious groups oppose their usage.",
    "Tax Shelters" : "By not fully taxing the wealth of the super-rich, tax shelters can be a great way to encourage successful entrepreneurs to make our country their home.\n\nWith an ever-shrinking world, the rich are free to settle wherever they please.\n\nEncouraging them to live here may mean that they spend their wealth in this country.\n\nSuch measures can be very unpopular with the poor, who resent paying tax on their much lower earnings.",
    "Technology Colleges" : "Technology colleges are 'specialist schools' with a focus on computer literacy, biotechnology and similar subjects.\n\nThese state-run colleges receive special funding from central government in order to encourage a greater level of technological literacy amongst the future workforce.",
    "Technology Grants" : "The government can provide state funding to encourage business to invest in new and exciting technologies.\n\nAlthough this helps give us a competitive advantage and can create jobs, it can be argued that its an unnecessary distortion of the market.",
    "Telecommuting" : "Telecommuting, or 'working from home' is seen as desirable because it reduces the pressure on the transport infrastructure, and can be an improvement to people's quality of life. It's also welcomed by parents.\n\nThis policy offers tax incentives to companies supporting this option.",
    "Tobacco Tax" : "Despite the failure of tobacco companies to admit it, there is good reason to believe that smoking has negative effects on health.\n\nThis is used as a justification for taxing tobacco.\n\nCynics point out that the government benefits hugely from a tax on a product it is supposedly against.\n\nHealth campaigners encourage the tax as a way to encourage a more healthy population",
    "Toll Roads" : "Toll roads charge motorists to use specific roads (normally major highways).\n\nThis is a great example of directly applying market forces, by only charging those who use a particular route for the construction and maintenance of that route.\n\nMotorists tend to see this as just another form of taxation, whereas commuters appreciate not being charged for roads they seldom use.",
    "Unemployed Benefit" : "Unemployment benefit is a state benefit given to everyone who is able to work but cannot find employment. Socialists regard this as a minimum safety net for workers out of work because of the whims of the economy. Some believe that high unemployment benefits distort the market and discourage people from seeking work.",
    "Uni Grants" : "Although not all citizens will pursue a university education, governments can provide subsidies to students to encourage a more educated workforce. University grants also ensure equality of opportunity, as in their absence the cost of a university education can be beyond the reach of working class families.",
    "Welfare Fraud" : "When government gives so much money out in welfare payments, it's essential that the money is correctly targeted and not exploited by people making spurious claims.\n\nA dedicated fraud department will detect false claimants, recover lost money and reassure middle income tax payers that their taxes are being spent wisely, although it can antagonize legitimate claimants.",
    "Winter Fuel" : "A special concession given to the elderly. This is a regular welfare payment made to everyone over retirement age towards the cost of their winter fuel bills.\n\nIt is designed to reduce 'fuel poverty' which can occur when some elderly members of society cannot afford to heat their homes in winter.",
    "Work Safety" : "Work safety law, often known as 'health and safety' is a series of measures to ensure employees are not at risk from injury in their day-to-day activities.\n\nTrade unionists often hail such laws as a valuable defense against unscrupulous employers who may put lives at risk.\n\nMany business leaders are concerned at the high levels of bureaucracy and restrictive practices that can result from such laws, which they see as a burden on business.",
    "Youth clubs" : "Free youth clubs ensure that teenagers have a 'place to go' which can help them to stay out of trouble, and in the long run, reduce the incidence of street crime.\n\nIt can be resented by some wealthier taxpayers, who see it as an unnecessary expense, paid for by their taxes.",
    "Abortion Law" : "Few areas of policy incite stronger emotions that the debate over abortion.\n\nOn the 'pro-life' side, are arguments about the rights of the unborn child, and arguments are often made from a religious standpoint.\n\nOn the 'pro-choice' side, there is the argument that the State should not have more say over what a woman does with her body than she does.\n\nMaking any change to the States position on abortion requires a hefty amount of political capital.",
    "Rent Controls" : "An alternative to state-housing is a system where the state will regulate the private-rental market in a bid to ensure the supply of affordable housing for all, even within the private sector.\n\nCapitalists will naturally see this as a distortion of the free market that will prevent enough homes being built, whereas supporters will say it prevents exploitation of the poor by greedy landlords.",
    "School Vouchers" : "A measure designed to encourage the growth of private schooling, whilst still enabling everyone to afford an education.\n\nSchool  vouchers are issued by the State to parents for each child which they can then spend in the private sector on education.\n\nThis is a different approach to pure state schooling because with school tax credits the schools are privately run and the teachers are no longer state employees.",
    "Oil Drilling" : "To encourage investment in new oil and gas drilling, and thus raise the supply of fossil fuel energy for the country, these tax breaks effectively subsidize fossil fuels.\n\nThis will indirectly reduce fuel prices and stimulate the economy, but will be an outrage to environmentalists.",
    "Mansion Tax" : "A special high rate of tax charged annually on the ownership of super-expensive homes.\n\nThis tax is popular with some because it is almost impossible to avoid, as homes cannot be easily hidden.\n\nIt is perceived as unfair by some elderly people who may have expensive homes but relatively low incomes, and thus have difficulty in paying the annual tax.\n\nIt is a form of wealth-tax, as opposed to income tax.",
    "Fuel Efficiency" : "Mandatory standards for new cars which dictate the minimum level of fuel efficiency.\n\nThis is a long term measure aimed to raise the fuel efficiency of the country's cars, and thus reduce our dependence on oil, as well as reducing the cost of driving over the long term.\n\nIt will be unpopular with car manufacturers, but a hit with environmentalists.",
    "Foreign Invest." : "Special tax breaks given to large foreign-owned multinational companies to encourage them to invest in our country.\n\nThis could include tax-free periods, introductory rates of corporate tax, and straight subsidies to encourage investment.\n\nHelps to encourage investment from overseas, but will be seen as incredibly unpatriotic, and pandering to the whims of huge foreign capitalist organizations.",
    "Robot Research" : "A special grant to encourage research in robotics.\n\nRobotics is a very long term area of research which will eventually bring about vast boosts in productivity.\n\nAt the same time it will reduce the amount of low or semi-skilled jobs in the economy, and thus potentially lead to higher unemployment.",
    "Private Prisons" : "Rather than directly control and manage a State prison service, this policy allows prisons to be privately owned and managed, and merely paid for by the state.\n\nPrivate prisons could result in lower cost and higher efficiency.\n\nThese measures will be unpopular with trade unionists.\n\nLiberals will have ethical concerns about profiting from incarceration, but still be pleased if spending is high enough to promote rehabilitation.",
    "Junk Food" : "A punitive tax rate charged on unhealthy food such as takeaway hamburgers, fizzy drinks and high sugar or fat content pre-processed food.\n\nLevied with the aim of improving the health of the nation, but can be unpopular.",
    "Health Food Subsidies" : "A tax incentive that makes healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, cheaper than the higher fat or higher sugar foods.\n\nSeen as an incentive to eat well, rather than a punishment for eating badly, and thus less punitive on the poor than a 'fat tax'.",
    "Tasers" : "A non-lethal but still highly effective (and possibly dangerous) weapon which effectively gives criminals an electric shock.\n\nSupporters say it is a good compromise between the need to disable violent criminals and the risk of death associated with traditional firearms.\n\nOpponents claim that the use of such weapons lowers the barrier-to-use for the police and will encourage more casual use of force against the population.",
    "Police Drones" : "Unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles, similar to remote control planes which can be employed by the police force.\n\nThe 'eye in the sky' is a useful way to keep track of mobs and rioters, and allows for subtle yet effective surveillance.\n\nThe police see it as a vital tool for modern crime fighting, but there are concerns that this is a step further towards a big-brother style surveillance society where everyone is tracked.",
    "Arts Subsidies" : "Investing public money in the arts is controversial with capitalists who see it as supporting uneconomic elitist entertainment, but others see it as vital to a countries culture, boosting our image on the world stage, and attracting tourists.",
    "Healthcare Vouchers" : "A measure designed to encourage the growth of private health care whilst still enabling everyone access to it.\n\nHealthcare vouchers are  issued by the State to everyone but can then only be spent in the private sector on health care.\n\nThis is a different approach to pure State health care because with health tax credits, the hospitals are privately run and the medical staff are no longer state employees.",
    "Health Tax Credits" : "A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private healthcare, in order to reduce their tax liability.\n\nThis boosts healthcare without involving the state running hospitals or employing doctors, but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place.",
    "School Tax Credits" : "A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private education in order to reduce their tax liability.\n\nThis boosts private schooling without involving the State running schools or employing teachers but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place.",
    "Food Stamps" : "Food stamps is a system where the state will issue vouchers or 'stamps' to those citizens on low or no income, to ensure they are able to afford food.\n\nUnlike giving a straight cash benefit, food stamps can only be redeemed for uncooked food, preventing them being used for unhealthy takeaway food.\n\nSupporters see food stamps as a valuable way to ensure nobody goes hungry, no matter their income.\n\nCritics consider such a scheme patronizing, and no more than papering over the cracks caused by free market failure and low wages.",
    "Food Standards Agency" : "A food standards agency is a branch of government dedicated to ensuring the safety and minimum nutritional standards of food supplied within the country.\n\nFarmers may regard the agency as an extra layer of bureaucracy and meddling, but public health campaigners see the agency as an essential line of defense between the consumer and unscrupulous food producers looking to cut costs.",
    "Enterprise Investment Scheme" : "The Enterprise Investment Scheme is a system which gives tax breaks to wealthy individuals who invest their money in small startup companies which are based in this country.\n\nThe scheme encourages investment in companies which should eventually grow and stimulate the economy, whilst at the same time giving a popular tax break to people who invest in them.\n\nObviously indirectly, the scheme is being subsidized by those without savings to invest.",
    "Recreational Drugs Tax" : "In societies that have legalized drugs such as Cannabis and Marijuana, there is a temptation to treat consumption of these drugs as a source of government revenue, given the claims that their consumption should be politely discouraged due to the negative effects on citizens health, in a similar way to governments taxing alcohol or tobacco.",
    "Gated Communities" : "A drastic solution to serious street crime and vandalism, gated communities are basically self-policed residential areas.\n\nThey are popular with the wealthy, but often associated with class divide and inequality, as only the relatively wealthy can afford to live inside them.\n\nAs a result, some governments are reluctant to permit their construction."
